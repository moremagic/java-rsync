# I heart rsync. #

But being that I'm a big fan of Java (and Eclipse, and Ant, and native solutions), I'd love rsync even more if there were

  * a native implementation for the Java platform
  * an Ant task for integrating rsync with the build
  * an Eclipse plugin for using it to sync projects with test and production systems
  * a Windows service for running it (with or without cygwin)
  * a cross-platform GUI for local configuration and scheduling

Others have tried and failed to write a Java implementation of rsync - I don't know why their projects sputtered and died.  (Probably because they like making money.)

I've taken on this project because of the intellectual challenge (I'm a Web developer by trade, but I'm sure I'm capable of more).

The project - being a learning experience for me - will remain 100% open source throughout its lifetime.  So branch it at any point, and make the project your own.  And feel free to [contact me for discussion](mailto:aaron@collegeman.net).

# Getting Started #

No distributions available yet.  Stay tuned.

# Understanding the Challenge #

I'm putting together a collection of documentation on Rsync - how it works, the basic building blocks of the algorithm, the strategy behind the network layer design.  You can follow along in AllAboutRsync.
