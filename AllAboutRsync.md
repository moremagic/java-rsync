Once you get past the algorithm, it's all downhill, right?  This is my collection of documentation on everything rsync - a history, of sorts, of the learning process.

## The Algorithm ##

The first (though not the best) resource for understanding the rsync algorithm is the author himself. Accompanying the Rsync Web site is a concise explanation of how the algorithm works, including the summation formulas used in his implementation of a fast, _rolling checksum_.
